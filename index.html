</p>
<p>
corruption in Bangladesh over the past 15 years (2010–2025), emphasizing key scandals, trends, and recent developments:

Corruption Trends & Perception (2010–2025)</br>
• Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) shows Bangladesh scoring between 25 and 28 from 2012 to 2022, reflecting moderate but persistent concerns .<br>
• In 2023, the score dropped to 24; by 2024, it further declined to 23, marking the lowest rating since 2012 and ranking 151st out of 180 countries—one of the worst rankings in South Asia after Afghanistan . 
</br> <br>Major Corruption Scandals (2010–2025)

<br>1. Hallmark-Sonali Bank Loan Scam (2010–2012)</br>

A massive fraud at the state-owned Sonali Bank where over Tk 35 billion was illicitly loaned to Hallmark Group and affiliates. It’s often described as the country’s largest banking fraud in decades .

<br>2. Padma Bridge Graft Scandal (2016–2017)</br>

Allegations surfaced that SNC-Lavalin offered bribes to secure the bridge contract. 
The World Bank withdrew funding; however, the charges were later dismissed after key evidence was excluded .

<br>3. Barapukuria Coal Scam (2018)</br>

Roughly 150,000 tons of coal were found missing from the Barapukuria mine—worth over BDT 227 billion—triggering a 
high-profile investigation and suspensions of officials .

<br>4. Rooppur “Pillow” Scandal (2019)</br>

An outrage over excessive spending on project housing for Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant staff—satirically 
dubbed the “pillow scandal.” Thirteen people were arrested, though the matter remains under legal consideration .

<br>5. 2020 Election Commission Misconduct</br>

<br>Allegations of embezzlement, misuse of funds for false programs, fraud in staff recruitment, overpriced equipment, and misuse of assets led citizens and experts to demand a formal investigation into EC commissioners .

Recent High-Profile Investigations & Asset Exposés</br>
<br>• £400 million UK Property Empire: After Sheikh Hasina’s ousting, the interim government discovered that elites close to her had amassed around £400 million in UK real estate, prompting recovery efforts .
<br>• Asset Accumulation by Saifuzzaman Chowdhury: The former land minister is alleged to hold 482 properties 
worth $295 million across several countries. Investigators attribute large-scale embezzlement and aid to
 “crony lending” systems .</br>
<br>• FBI Money Laundering Findings: The US FBI discovered that Sajeeb Wazed, Sheikh Hasina’s son,
 owned luxury vehicles and engaged in laundering funds (~$300 million) to the US and UK. An ACC probe is ongoing .</br>
<br>• Tulip Siddiq (UK MP) Trial: Hasina’s niece, Tulip Siddiq, faces corruption charges tied to
 plotting improper land acquisition or embezzlement linked to a nuclear deal. She denies wrongdoing,
  calling the case politically driven. She recently resigned from her UK ministerial role and is being further 
  scrutinized over alleged UK assets and dual citizenship .</br>

<br>Period Highlights</br>
<br>2010–2019 Hallmark loan scam, Padma Bridge, Barapukuria coal, Rooppur scandal</br>
<br>2020–2022 EC corruption allegations, CPI decline trend begins</br>
<br>2023–2025 Lowest CPI score since 2012, asset investigations of Hasina-era figures</br>

<br>Takeaways</br>
<br>• Despite some institutional rhetoric against corruption, CPI performance shows a downward trend, indicating growing systemic weaknesses.
<br>• Scandals span banking, infrastructure, energy, election oversight, and real estate.</br>
<br>• Recent probes by the interim government illustrate intensified efforts to reclaim assets and hold powerful </br>
figures accountable</br>

<button class="p-botton">  <h1>THE DAY PIZZA MET PASTA </h1></button></br>
</p>
<p>
In a small coastal town in southern Italy, there was a little trattoria run by Nonna Rosa, a grandmother famous for two things:

Her wood-fired margherita pizza, with a crust so perfect it could make you cry.<br>



But Nonna Rosa had one rule carved in stone:

“Pizza is for the hands. Pasta is for the fork. Never mix them!”

One summer afternoon, a tourist from Canada walked into the trattoria. His Italian wasn’t great, but his hunger was 
massive. He looked at the menu, scratched his head, and said:



“Can I have… pizza with pasta on top?”


The whole restaurant froze. A fork clattered to the floor. Somewhere, an accordion stopped playing.

“Pizza… con pasta?!” Nonna Rosa repeated, clutching her heart.



But she was also a woman of curiosity. So, with a dramatic sigh, she decided to try. She made a thin, crispy pizza base, spread fresh
 tomato sauce, sprinkled mozzarella, then piled on steaming tagliatelle tossed with basil pesto. She served it to the Canadian with 
 a shake of her head, expecting disaster.<br>



The man took a bite… and his eyes lit up. The room waited.

“This,” he declared, “is the best thing I’ve ever eaten.”



Within a week, locals were secretly ordering pizza con pasta. By the end of summer, it became the trattoria’s “off-menu special.” And though Nonna Rosa would still tell people:



“Tradition is important, but sometimes… rules are meant to be broken,”


…she kept a small note under her cash register that read.<br>

</p>
<body>
    <p>
In a small mountain town, there was a tea garden café run by an old woman named Aunty Reba. She wasn’t rich,
 but her cooking had magic in it—especially her pumpkin soup.<br>

One winter, a fierce snowstorm hit. Roads closed, markets emptied, and people were stuck in
 their homes without much to eat. But Aunty Reba? She had a habit of saving every pumpkin seed from the autumn harvest, drying them, 
 and planting more the next season. She also stored jars of her special spice mix—ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, and a secret pinch of
  something no one could guess.<br>

When the snow trapped the whole town, she opened her little café and began making giant 
pots of soup. People trudged through the snow just to have a bowl—hot steam fogging up the windows, the smell 
of roasted pumpkin wrapping around them like a blanket.<br>

No one paid in money that week. Instead, they brought whatever they had—apples, tea leaves, 
firewood, even a rabbit someone had found wandering in the cold (don’t worry, it became a pet, not dinner).<br>

When spring came, people still remembered that soup—not just for its taste, but because it
 reminded them that food isn’t only about feeding the body. It’s about warming the soul, bringing people
  together when the world feels cold.<br>
